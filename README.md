This is my personal Vim setup. I found NeoVim to be a large hassle and VSCode didn't feel fun to use, so this is what I ended up with. Yes, both has better GUI than ancient Vim, but as long as my text editor's keybinds feel cohesive, plugins are back-compatible, and remote editing is zippy, I'm fine with taking the loss.
